FieldFix: 
A web app using Python to help farmers identify crop problems quickly. 
The app uses Google’s Gemini Pro API to check images for pests, diseases, ripeness, and weeds. 
I used Python for everything from reading and resizing images to sending them to the API and displaying results. 
I chose Streamlit for the interface because it’s simple and fast to set up. 
Users can upload a photo, and within seconds the app gives a clear diagnosis along with confidence scores. 
I also used Matplotlib to present the results in an easy-to-read format.  
This project helped me improve my Python skills, especially in API integration and data visualization, while creating something that could actually help in sustainable farming.
